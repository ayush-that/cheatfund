- ✅ Next.js application foundation ready
- ✅ Wallet integration working
- ✅ UI components library (shadcn) installed

### Implementation Order

1. **Start with**: [Contract Integration Examples](./CONTRACT_INTEGRATION_EXAMPLES.md) - Set up the foundation
2. **Follow with**: [Step-by-Step Implementation Plan](./STEP_BY_STEP_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) - Execute the plan
3. **Reference**: [UI Components Specification](./UI_COMPONENTS_SPECIFICATION.md) - Build components
4. **Consult**: [Frontend Implementation Guide](../FRONTEND_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) - For architectural decisions

## 🚀 Current Status

### ✅ Complete (Smart Contracts)

- ChitFund contract with full functionality
- ChitFundFactory for fund creation
- Comprehensive testing suite
- Deployment scripts and configuration

### 🚧 In Progress (Frontend Integration)

- Contract integration layer
- UI component implementation
- Real-time updates system
